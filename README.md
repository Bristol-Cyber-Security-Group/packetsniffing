# packetsniffing
There are three files, the livecapture will capture packets and give the output in a text file with IP address, reverse DNS and protocol
The offline capture is a simple sniffing. 
The readpcap.py will read pcap files and output a csv file with source destination, protocol, size and hostname of the destination
There are duplicates as of now.
